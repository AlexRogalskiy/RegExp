# Registry Explorer

Replacement for the Windows built-in *Regedit.exe* tool. Improvements over that tool include:

* Show real Registry (not just the standard one)
* Sort list view by any column
* Key details: last write time and number of keys/values.
* Full search (Find All / Ctrl+Shift+F)
* Enhanced hex editor for binary values
* Undo/redo
* Copy/paste of keys/values
* more to come!
